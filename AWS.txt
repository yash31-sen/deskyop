Multitenancy: sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines.
Hypervizer: responsible for co-ordinating multitenancy, it is manged by aws
	-> responsible for isolating the virtual machines form each other as they share resources from the host 
this means EC2 instances are secure even though they share resources but one EC2 instance don't know about the other instance

CaaS(Compute as a Servic model). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

EC2 isntance Families:
1) Geeral Purpose (Balanced Resources -> Web servers, Code repositoies etc)
2)Compute Optimized (compute intenssive tasks -> gaming servers, High performance computing, scientific modeling etc)
3)Memory optimized (For memory intenssive tasks
4)Accelerated otimized (floating popint number caculation, graphic processing, Data pattern matching, utilize hd acceleratr)
5)Storage otimized (High pergormace for locally stored data)

Reserved Instances require a contract length of either 1 year or 3 years. The workload in this scenario will only be running for 6 months.
Dedicated Instances run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. They have a higher cost than the other response options, which run on shared hardware.
On-Demand Instances fulfill the requirements of running for only 6 months. However, a Spot Instance would be the best choice because it does not require a minimum contract length, is able to withstand interruptions, and costs less than an On-Demand Instance.

EC2 instance Pricing:


Purchase options:
1)On-Demand
2)Saving Plans
3)Reserved Instance 
4)Spot instances 
5)Dedicated host


Scalliung Problems get solved with the help of Amazon EC2 auto scaling feature 


Elastic Load Balancing:
it is regional construct



Messsaging and Queuing:
Placing idea into the buffer is called as messagig and queing





Amazon SQS:

Send Store and Recieve message between software compontents at any volume 
SQS queus are place where the message is placed untill they are processed
aws uses underlying infrastucture to host those queus



Amazon SNS:
can be used to send notifications to the users (SMS, Emails etc)

SNS topic:
A channel for message to be delivered 

-------------------------------
In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because they are communicating with each other. The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing. 
as they are using queus

Additional Compute services:

1)Serverlses Computing 
	-> AWS Lambda:
		-> it is designed t run codes with in 15 minutes
		-> 
2) AWS container Serives:
Container is a package for our code
	-> AWS ECS(Elastic Container Service)
	-> AWS EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service) 
		-> the conteiner in both the cases is docker container uses os level virtualization
		-> both run on top of EC2	

AWS Fargate(opens in a new tab) is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. 



________
to host traditinal appliction
Full access to the os
use EC2

____________
Host Short running function
Dont want tmanage underlying infrastucutre 
Event Driven applciatin
No provisioning to manage servers 
use AWS lambda
_____________

for running Doker 
Container based models 
use EKS or ECS
