Furthermore, I had the opportunity to be a Cisco Virtual Intern, where I gained an understanding of Python. I have developed several projects, such as a Hand Gesture-Based Operating System Desktop App, and I have earned various certification courses. These experiences demonstrate my ability to translate technical knowledge into practical implementations.

I have always been passionate about learning new things, exploring opportunities, and dedicating myself fully to the work assigned to me.

what is your waekness?

1) Because I like working independently and quickly it is challanging for me to ask for a help when needed but now i have been pushing myself to go to experts and ask them for pecific knowledge that can improve my work.

2)My biggest weakness is that sometomes i get too much into the details of a project or task assign to me and spent time analyzing the smallest thigs but now i have been checking up myself regularly and trying to focus on the bigger picture so that I can also reach the quality but alos meet the deadline.
